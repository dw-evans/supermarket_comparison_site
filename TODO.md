# To Do List


- Search result caching
    - Just use pickle? Otherwise need a serialiser and deserialiser which I cba with
- Add filters and sorters to html

---

- Come up with container for sorters and filter options
    - Needs to have clickable boxes which submit post requests to change the state of the filter
    - What is a good way to store the filter state? Probably just initialise it on runtime of views.py for example and have the post requests modify the filter based on the entries


---

- Update guthub so the good projects are public and the rest private
